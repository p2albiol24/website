Neil deGrasse Tyson is a world-known astrophysicist who has starred on many American documentaries<br>
and television shows on the subject of extra-planetary education. Born in Manhattan in 1958, <br>
Tyson always had a fascination of space and planetary bodies. At age 9, he visited the Hayden <br>
Planetarium, and reportedly felt that the skies were calling to him. During high school, he <br>
became well known at the planetarium for his frequent visits and even enrolled in an extracurricular <br>
class. He later became an undergraduate from Harvard with a degree in physics, and finished off <br>
in UTA. One of his many talents include being able to describe extremely complex ideas, concepts, and <br>
theories in simple terms that young children can understand.
<br><br><br><br>
Why I chose Neil. Well in my opinion, he is an awesome guy with an incredibly complex mind that <br>
he uses to enourage other people into studying the stars. I honestly have learned quite a bit from <br>
him, just watching his lectures, speeches, and documentaries. Obviously not comparable to anything <br>
that qualified people know, but enough to pique my interest and set me on a path to try and focus my <br>
career towards that.
